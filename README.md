### `user@hakka:~$ whoami`

I am a 23-year-old developer based in **Venezuela**. Standing at 2 meters tall, I spend most of my time looking down at the physical world and staring directly into the digital one. 

I don't just use Linux; I grew up in it. I have been running **Arch Linux since I was 10 years old**. I prefer minimalism, control, and systems that do exactly what I tell them to do—nothing more, nothing less.

My aesthetic is defined by the hum of servers and the static of the CRT.

### `user@hakka:~$ cat /etc/interests`

My downtime is dedicated to high-skill gameplay and narrative consumption.

*   **The Bullet Hell:** deeply invested in the **Touhou Project** universe.
*   **The Grind:** **Phantasy Star Online** veteran.
*   **The Narrative:** I consume Manga and Anime with a critical eye.
    *   *Favorites:* **Konosuba** (Megumin is the path), **Serial Experiments Lain** (the bible), and **Berserk**.
    *   *Current Status:* Catching up on the One Piece monolith.
